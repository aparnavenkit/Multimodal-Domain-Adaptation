23.7	30.6	[whale , dolphin , sea lion ]	sea lion can't give birth while swimming, as whales and dolphins do, but have to come ashore.
30.8	35.3	[]	and here, in dense groups, moving awkwardly between land and sea,
35.5	40.2	[sea lion ]	sea lion're a great temptation to any hunter that can reach them.
43.3	45.5	[sea lion ]	sea lion nursery beach seems secure.
45.7	51.9	[]	on the landward side are steep cliffs, and on the other side the beach is protected by the sea.
52.1	55.1	[]	but the sea itself can harbour enemies.
64.5	68.5	[whale ]	a killer whale 30 feet long, eight tons in weight.
68.6	75.4	[sea lion , lion , whale ]	every year the same group of a dozen of whale assemble off the sea lion nursery to hunt.
75.6	80.3	[sea lion , lion ]	for sea lions to venture into deep water here is very dangerous indeed.
80.4	84.2	[sea lion ]	it's much safer to stay in the shallows if sea lion can.
113.0	118.4	[whale ]	in one or two places, channels enable the whales to get really close to the beach.
118.6	121.0	[]	those are the danger spots.
149.4	153.4	[]	to get off the beach, the killer has to thrash its body.
158.0	161.5	[whale ]	no other whale deliberately beaches itself in this way
161.7	165.7	[]	or has perfected this method of getting back to the sea.
181.4	186.7	[sea lion , lion ]	as long as the sea lions stay well up the beach, you might think they'd be safe,
186.9	189.5	[whale ]	but the hungry whales are very daring.
203.6	207.6	[whale ]	now several of the whales are hunting in a group.
228.0	231.1	[sea lion , whale , lion ]	that sea lion was keeping ahead of one whale
231.3	234.9	[]	but was caught by another it probably hadn't seen.
288.1	293.8	[]	this extraordinary wildlife sequence was shot by the bbc natural history unit
294.0	297.8	[]	for a major series called "the trials of life".
298.0	302.9	[]	it's surely one of the most spectacular wildlife sequences ever filmed.
303.1	305.5	[]	but it's by no means alone.
307.3	315.1	[]	for the past 50 years, the natural history unit has been filming nature at its most dramatic,
315.3	321.8	[]	so that we at home can see the natural world at its most spectacular and its most intimate.
322.0	329.5	[]	but filming such a moment once is not enough. you have to do it from several points of view.
329.7	335.0	[]	it's that that turns a good sequence into an astounding one.
335.2	338.4	[whale ]	take the killer whale sequence we've just seen.
338.6	342.8	[]	there were two cameramen involved mike degruy and paul atkins.
343.0	346.8	[]	paul's job was to get the underwater shots in the channel,
347.0	350.1	[whale ]	an area whale called the death zone.
350.3	353.1	[]	mike's job was equally unenviable.
353.3	361.2	[whale , seal ]	it was to lie in the surf and get shots that give the point of view of the seal of an attacking whale.
361.4	364.7	[]	all this sounds above and beyond the call of duty.
364.9	369.7	[whale , seal ]	but mike was confident that once the whale recognised ## wasn't a seal,
369.8	372.9	[]	it wouldn't go through with the full attack.
373.0	376.2	[]	it didn't take long for his theory to be tested.
376.4	382.1	[whale ]	a whale rushed in, paused, and then turned away at the last minute.
382.3	388.1	[whale ]	so whale carefully judged daring created a moment of television history
388.3	392.1	[]	that made its way into the memory of a generation.
392.3	396.7	[]	there have been many more such moments both before and since.
396.9	401.9	[whale ]	now, for the first time, whale're compiled into one collection.
402.0	407.3	[]	categorised by regions, it travels from the vast expanses of the world's oceans
407.5	411.0	[]	to the claustrophobic tangle of this planet's jungles,
411.2	415.7	[]	from the skies above to the wide, open spaces below.
415.8	420.9	[]	this collection takes us to places that are still unspoilt wildernesses,
421.1	423.9	[whale ]	and long may whale continue to be so.
424.1	429.4	[]	so, here are the greatest wildlife moments so far.
444.1	448.2	[]	this is natal, on south africa's eastern seaboard.
448.4	453.4	[]	it's june, and just offshore strange black patches have appeared.
457.0	460.8	[whale ]	whale look like immense oil slicks up to a mile long.
463.0	469.3	[sardin ]	but this is a living slick, millions and millions of sardines on a marine migration
469.4	475.4	[]	that, in terms of sheer biomass, rivals that of the wildebeest on the grasslands of africa.
479.4	484.0	[gannet ]	these fish live most of the time in the cold waters south of the cape,
484.2	487.0	[]	but each year the coastal currents reverse.
487.2	490.6	[]	the warm agulhas current that flows from the north
490.8	496.5	[]	has been displaced by cold water from the south, and that has brought up rich nutrients.
496.7	502.7	[sardin , plankton , gannet ]	gannet in turn have created a bloom of plankton and the sardines are now feasting on it.
512.4	517.5	[sardin ]	as the sardines travel north, a whole caravan of predators follow them.
521.2	524.3	[sardin , gannet ]	thousands of cape gannets track the sardines.
524.4	531.7	[gannet ]	gannet nested and timed their breeding so that their chicks can join them in pursuing the shoals.
539.0	543.7	[shark ]	below water, hundreds of sharks have also joined the caravan.
546.6	552.9	[shark ]	these are bronze whaler sharks, a cold-water species that normally lives much further south.
558.3	563.5	[sardin , shark ]	these three-metre sharks cut such great swathes through the sardine shoals
563.6	567.2	[shark ]	that shark tracks are clearly visible from the air.
567.4	571.9	[]	harried by packs of predators and swept in by the action of the waves,
572.1	575.5	[sardin ]	the sardine shoals are penned close to the shore.
593.0	597.3	[dolphin ]	common dolphin are coming in from the open ocean to join the feast.
612.1	616.1	[dolphin ]	there are over a thousand of dolphin in this one school.
623.7	628.2	[sardin , dolphin ]	when dolphin catch up with the sardines, the action really begins.
632.1	636.1	[dolphin ]	working together, dolphin drive the shoal towards the surface.
644.5	648.3	[dolphin ]	it's easier for the dolphins to snatch fish up here.
662.2	665.2	[sardin ]	now the sardines have no escape.
676.6	682.4	[dolphin , sardin , gannet ]	thanks to the dolphins, the sardines have come within the diving range of the gannets.
693.8	700.4	[bear ]	hundreds of white arrows shoot into the sea, leaving long trails of bubbles behind each dive.
712.2	715.1	[shark ]	next to join the frenzy are the sharks.
727.6	730.6	[dolphin , shark ]	sharks get excited when dolphins are around.
730.8	735.6	[dolphin , sardin , shark ]	shark can feed particularly well once the dolphins have driven the sardines
735.8	738.7	[]	into more compact groups near the surface.
742.4	746.4	[]	as the frenzy continues, walls of bubbles drift upwards.
749.3	754.1	[dolphin , shark ]	shark're being released by the dolphins, working together in teams.
756.2	761.2	[sardin , shark ]	shark use the bubbles to corral the sardines into ever tighter groups.
764.3	769.3	[sardin ]	the sardines seldom cross the wall of bubbles and crowd closer together.
772.5	778.5	[dolphin , sardin ]	bubble netting in this way enables the dolphins to grab every last trapped sardine.
790.2	795.0	[whale ]	just when the feasting seems to be almost over, a bryde's whale.
799.4	804.9	[whale ]	the survivors head on northwards and the caravan of predators follows whale.
811.6	818.3	[]	some of these islands are virtually unexplored, but the waters in between are a sea of surprises.
832.4	835.9	[eleph ]	in mid-afternoon, the elephants take to the ocean.
846.2	851.6	[mahout ]	mahouts guide them through the water by pressing a foot behind the ears.
874.4	880.4	[eleph ]	these are working elephants. sometimes they swim a kilometre or more between islands.
881.9	888.7	[eleph ]	this is a family group. if the elephant gets tired, its mother and aunt will be there to support it.
898.2	900.8	[]	the islands are still heavily forested.
901.0	905.6	[eleph ]	elephants are used to haul timber, which is ruthlessly exploited.
910.7	912.8	[]	despite these alarming pressures,
913.0	919.0	[]	the islands still embrace some of the most pristine expanses of rainforest in india.

1025.6	1028.8	[]	heading for the nearest shore to spawn.
1043.6	1047.5	[]	it's exhausting, especially if there's little to drink,
1047.7	1053.1	[]	so the legions march mostly while it's cool in the early morning and evening.
1054.7	1058.2	[crab ]	for crab, this migration is an essential journey.
1058.4	1060.7	[crab ]	unable to raise crab young on land,
1060.9	1067.7	[crab ]	these crabs must trek several kilometres each year to their ancestral home, the sea.
1122.0	1127.2	[]	the journey is perilous, for the exodus from the forest along traditional routes
1127.4	1130.7	[crab ]	brings many of crab into an alien world.

1150.4	1153.2	[]	phosphate used to be mined on the island
1153.4	1158.7	[crab ]	and a million crabs a year are crushed by the trains and road traffic.
1170.0	1175.1	[]	the carnage accounts for only one per cent, and the dead are quickly scavenged.
1175.3	1182.2	[crab ]	occasionally, the crabs hit back, as their powerful claws puncture the tyres that kill them.
1186.4	1192.8	[crab ]	by early december, the residents of christmas island wake up to find crabs on their doorsteps.
1194.7	1199.8	[]	it may seem like a living nightmare, but most people here carry on regardless,
1200.0	1206.4	[]	and have learned to work around the invasion of these crustaceans, which you can't even eat.
1215.0	1221.0	[crab ]	the migrating creatures turn up everywhere and crab certainly have no regard for fair play.
1223.0	1228.1	[crab ]	this golf course even has special rules for when crabs get in on the game.
1242.2	1247.1	[]	descend below 1,000 metres and you enter the dark zone.
1247.3	1250.6	[]	no sunlight whatsoever penetrates this deep.
1250.8	1254.8	[]	the temperature of the water has dropped below 4° centigrade.
1255.0	1259.4	[]	the pressure is more than 100 times that at the surface.
1261.0	1266.3	[]	life becomes ever more sparse. it's a dark, dangerous world.
1272.0	1276.7	[]	relative to body size, these are the largest teeth in the ocean.
1276.9	1281.0	[crab ]	crab're so big that their owner can't even close its mouth.
1285.6	1288.6	[fangtooth , crab ]	crab belong to the fangtooth.
1292.0	1297.9	[jelli ]	unlike most deep-sea fish, this has powerful muscles and is an aggressive hunter.
1307.0	1309.7	[]	with food in short supply at this depth,
1309.9	1315.3	[]	dark-zone predators have to be able to deal with a meal of almost any size.
1319.3	1323.6	[crab , jelli ]	many jellys here are dark red, like this deep-sea jelly.
1334.3	1340.3	[]	caught in the lights of the submersible, it's a spectacular firework display of colour.
1345.0	1348.5	[crab ]	normally, no red light penetrates as deep as this,
1348.6	1354.6	[crab ]	so crabs with red pigment appear completely black down here, perfectly concealed.
1363.4	1366.8	[]	dwarfed by the vast expanse of the open ocean,
1367.0	1370.6	[crab ]	the biggest crab that has ever lived on our planet.

1387.7	1393.1	[eleph ]	its tongue weighs as much as an elephant, its heart is the size of a car,
1393.3	1398.3	[eleph ]	and some of its blood vessels are so wide that you could swim down elephant.
1399.7	1404.3	[]	its tail alone is the width of a small aircraft's wings.
1422.3	1427.9	[]	its streamlining, close to perfection, enables it to cruise at 20 knots.
1428.0	1431.0	[eleph ]	it's one of the fastest elephants in the sea.
1435.3	1440.8	[]	the ocean's largest inhabitant feeds almost exclusively on one of the smallest

1465.2	1470.5	[whale ]	despite the enormous size of blue whales, we know very little about them.
1470.7	1476.7	[whale ]	whale migration routes are still a mystery and we have no idea where they go to breed.
1480.5	1484.6	[whale ]	whale are a dramatic reminder of how much we still have to learn

1533.1	1536.5	[tiger ]	tiger's definitely interested in mating.
1547.2	1552.4	[tiger ]	tiger's much bigger than maachli, so this is a really risky moment for her.
1556.9	1562.0	[tiger ]	will tiger give in and let him mate with her or will ## try and fight him off?
1578.7	1585.6	[tiger ]	it looks like tiger's keeping down, away from nick, so ## can't get behind her and mount her.
1587.8	1590.8	[tiger ]	nick's really enticed by her scent now.
1606.5	1609.5	[]	there's a real tension in the air.
1611.6	1613.9	[tiger ]	nick doesn't look like giving up.
1617.7	1620.0	[tiger ]	tiger're about to go for each other.
1639.8	1646.8	[tiger ]	maachli still has the fight in her and it looks like tiger's managed to wound more than nick's pride.
1659.9	1665.3	[tiger ]	this gash is going to make it hard for nick to hunt over the next few days.
1673.1	1678.7	[tiger ]	strange though it may seem, some plants can move not just tiger flowers and leaves,
1678.9	1681.8	[tiger ]	but tiger can travel from place to place.
1682.0	1685.0	[brambl ]	take, for example, this bramble.
1695.9	1700.4	[]	of all the woodland plants, this is one of the most aggressive.
1703.9	1710.5	[]	it waves its shoots agitatedly from side to side, as if feeling for the best way forward.
1713.9	1719.7	[]	and when a shoot settles on its course, it thrusts ahead relentlessly.
1734.7	1737.7	[]	the invading stem's backward-pointing spines
1737.9	1743.3	[]	give it the grip it needs to climb over almost anything that stands in its way.
1753.5	1757.5	[]	it can advance as much as three inches in a day.
1776.6	1783.4	[]	the first europeans to visit these caves noticed marks like these in the walls
1783.6	1787.1	[brambl ]	and imagined bramble had been made by ancient egyptians
1787.3	1790.7	[]	who came here to mine for gold and precious stones.
1790.9	1795.7	[]	and, certainly, these grooves do look like the marks made by a pickaxe.
1795.8	1800.8	[brambl ]	but to discover what actually made bramble, you have to wait until nightfall.
1802.5	1807.7	[brambl ]	we've set up infrared lights that the brambles can't see but our cameras can,
1807.9	1812.4	[]	and i'll be able to keep watch from the safety of a side chamber.
1814.7	1821.7	[bat ]	the bats are beginning to stir, preparing to leave to search for their food in the night skies outside.
1823.8	1828.6	[]	in a few minutes' time, it'll be as dark outside as it is in here.

1834.8	1838.9	[bushbuck ]	bushbuck. they're looking extremely nervous.
1841.2	1845.1	[buffalo ]	and that's why. there's a buffalo close by.
1846.0	1850.3	[buffalo ]	buffalo're only a few feet apart, but they can't see one another.
1858.9	1865.8	[]	you've got to remember that as far as it is concerned, it's in pitch blackness.
1866.0	1868.7	[]	it seems to be searching for something.
1873.7	1878.3	[]	it's eating. you can see its throat as it swallows.
1878.4	1882.2	[]	and it's understandably very nervous and apprehensive.
1883.9	1885.9	[]	it's licking salt.
1889.3	1891.2	[]	(low rumbling)
1891.4	1894.4	[bushbuck ]	the bushbuck has heard something.
1894.6	1897.3	[]	it sounds like distant thunder.
1902.6	1904.6	[eleph ]	it's an elephant.
1915.6	1918.5	[]	every foot is being placed very carefully.
1927.6	1930.5	[eleph ]	elephant bumped his head. well, no one's perfect.
1940.5	1946.2	[]	and this deep rumble, this resonating noise that's coming,
1946.4	1950.3	[]	that's probably a signal to others waiting outside the cave,
1950.4	1953.4	[eleph ]	because elephant's by himself at the moment.
1958.3	1961.6	[]	that's the picture from our camera at the cave mouth.
1961.8	1965.6	[]	the rest of the herd are climbing up to the entrance.
1965.8	1969.1	[eleph ]	how elephant're managing this steep slope i don't know.
1970.5	1973.1	[eleph ]	there's even a young calf among elephant.
1983.9	1988.5	[eleph ]	maybe the elephant's rumbles were messages to say that all is safe.
1993.8	1997.9	[eleph ]	elephant're following exactly the same path that the male took.
1998.8	2004.3	[eleph ]	look how the elephant's using her trunk to guide her calf over the cave floor.
2012.1	2015.1	[eleph ]	has elephant detected one of our cameras?
2018.2	2022.2	[eleph ]	maybe not, but elephant clearly know where they're going.
2028.9	2034.6	[eleph ]	the passage here is so narrow that the big elephant can only just squeeze through.
2044.3	2047.2	[]	and now i can hear. that noise...
2047.4	2055.0	[eleph ]	elephant's using his tusks to gouge out the salt, and, of course, it's falling to the ground.
2055.2	2061.9	[eleph ]	so what elephant does now is use his trunk to sniff it up and then blow it into his mouth.
2062.0	2064.4	[]	you can hear that too.
2075.4	2079.1	[eleph ]	elephants must have been coming here for centuries,
2079.2	2081.5	[]	each generation deepening the cave
2081.7	2088.1	[]	and passing on to the next its knowledge of the route through the darkness to the precious salt.
2092.5	2099.3	[eleph ]	so the marks near the cave entrance were not made by ancient egyptians but by elephants.
2120.4	2124.3	[]	what bird has the most elaborate,
2124.4	2128.0	[]	the most complex, the most beautiful song in the world?
2128.2	2132.6	[eleph ]	there are lots of contenders, but this bird must be one of elephant
2132.8	2136.8	[lyrebird ]	the superb lyrebird of southern australia.
2143.2	2145.1	[]	(shrill chirping)
2150.8	2155.2	[lyrebird ]	lyrebird clears a space in the forest to serve as his concert platform.
2166.9	2172.9	[lyrebird ]	to persuade females to come close, lyrebird sings the most complex song ## can manage,
2173.0	2178.1	[lyrebird ]	and lyrebird does that by copying the songs of all the other birds ## hears around him,
2178.2	2180.2	[kookaburra ]	such as the kookaburra.
2180.4	2182.4	[]	(squawking)

2259.0	2261.4	[]	(sawing noises)
2271.8	2273.8	[]	(chirping)
2278.8	2282.4	[]	that wonderful performance is only one example
2282.6	2287.2	[kookaburra ]	of the extent to which kookaburra birds will go in order to attract a female.

3651.4	3655.9	[bear ]	a high slope above the sea ice is a relatively safe position for a bear's maternity den.
3659.7	3663.7	[bear , penguin ]	large penguin, who sometimes bother a mother bear, avoid these steeper places,

4692.4	4696.7	[]	disproportionately long legs, evolved from movement in the trees,

4699.5	4703.5	[sifaka ]	for sifakas, bouncing sideways seems the only alternative.
4709.2	4714.1	[sifaka ]	but, for a sifaka, the method has first to be learnt and then perfected.
4730.9	4734.2	[]	an adult's movement is like a gymnastic ballet.
4744.8	4748.7	[sifaka ]	while the sifaka looks more like a child in a sack race.

4774.6	4779.4	[]	are subject to the pull of one great force the force of gravity.
4779.6	4786.1	[]	were that to be suspended, even for a moment, the most extraordinary things would happen.
4786.2	4792.8	[]	i, for example, would suddenly float into the air, because i at the moment...
4794.4	4803.1	[]	am flying in an aircraft on a very special course which in effect cancels out the effect of gravity.
4803.3	4808.0	[]	so i float easily through the air.
4808.8	4813.4	[]	our plane is climbing and diving as though it were on a giant roller coaster,
4813.6	4820.2	[]	and as it goes over the crest of its climb, it really lifts you out of your seat and keeps you there.
4821.9	4826.2	[sifaka ]	if there were no gravity on earth, seas would rise from sifaka beds,
4826.4	4831.4	[]	just as this water lifts out of its cup and disintegrates into droplets.
4842.4	4847.3	[]	nothing would remain where it was placed. there would be no up and no down.
4847.5	4853.5	[]	there would no longer be the sense of earthly order that we take so much for granted.
4856.2	4861.8	[sifaka ]	some creatures have overcome the force of gravity sufficiently to enable sifaka to fly,
4862.0	4866.8	[]	but the only ones that match this total freedom in the air that i have now
4867.0	4870.6	[sifaka ]	are those so small that sifaka are, in effect, weightless.
4873.8	4876.9	[]	this is the congress avenue bridge in austin, texas.
4877.1	4883.1	[]	in the heart of town, it may not seem a likely home for wildlife. but look again.

4899.6	4905.1	[]	we are creatures of the light. in the centre of town, it's shop till you drop.
4908.0	4912.3	[]	but underneath the arches, the night shift is taking it easy.
4913.9	4916.3	[bat ]	the bats are biding their time.
4943.9	4950.8	[bat ]	as sunset approaches, the bats fly out to look for food, all one and half million of them.
4958.5	4963.0	[]	in the summer, the shady bridge provides a cool place to hang out
4963.2	4966.3	[bat ]	until it's time for bat autumn migration.
4969.0	4972.8	[bat ]	in a few weeks, bat'll head south across the rio grande
4973.0	4975.0	[]	to spend the winter in mexico.

5009.9	5014.7	[eagl ]	in the dadia mountains in greece, golden eagles hunt over open forest,
5014.9	5020.1	[eagl ]	but eagle long wings create problems when chasing their prey among the trees.
5025.6	5029.0	[eagl ]	eagle have found an unlikely alternative prey.
5034.4	5039.8	[tortois ]	soaring, as a search technique, is equally effective for finding tortoises.
5041.1	5043.3	[]	but stopping seems like overkill,
5043.4	5048.8	[]	and to avoid crashing into trees, it applies the brakes as it nears the ground.
5051.2	5055.1	[]	the armoured shell presents an intriguing challenge.

5122.8	5128.6	[tortois ]	the impact separates the tortoise shell into two halves, like loosening a lid.
5133.6	5139.7	[eagl , tortois ]	eagles here feed almost exclusively on tortoises, and they've all learned the same trick.
5144.2	5149.5	[eagl ]	in forests, tree nests are common, but too many trees and the eagles can't hunt,
5149.7	5151.7	[tortois ]	even for tortoises.
5181.6	5183.6	[]	down goes the counterweight.
5184.9	5190.6	[]	and now i'm leaving that dark world of the forest floor,
5190.8	5193.5	[]	and really entering a completely new one.
5193.7	5199.7	[bird of paradis ]	now i'm getting up into the canopy, into the world of the birds of paradise.
5209.9	5212.3	[]	and here's the top.
5214.6	5218.7	[]	the birds are in another emergent tree just like this one,
5218.9	5222.9	[bird of paradis ]	and i've got an absolutely clear view of bird of paradise.
5223.1	5227.9	[bird of paradis ]	it's not likely that bird of paradise're going to take fright at my sudden appearance
5228.1	5232.6	[bird of paradis ]	because bird of paradise've been using that tree for generation after generation,
5232.8	5236.8	[bird of paradis ]	and it will take a lot more than just me to put bird of paradise off it.
5243.2	5246.4	[]	this, at last, is wallace's picture come to life.
5246.6	5250.1	[bird of paradis ]	bird of paradise was the first european to glimpse this spectacle,
5250.3	5253.9	[bird of paradis ]	and bird of paradise knew well, in general terms, what was happening.
5254.0	5260.1	[bird of paradis ]	this is a female. bird of paradise's come to pick a mate from among the gorgeous males who are displaying.
5270.9	5276.1	[bird of paradis ]	a young male. bird of paradise's dancing even though ## hasn't yet got his plumes.
5276.3	5279.9	[bird of paradis ]	they don't develop until bird of paradise's six or seven years old.
5293.0	5298.2	[bird of paradis ]	there are several young bird of paradise here putting in a little dancing practice.
5299.2	5302.1	[bird of paradis ]	this, however, is almost certainly a bird of paradise,
5302.3	5308.3	[bird of paradis ]	because the bird of paradise are starting the second stage of their performance the bow, head down.
5318.1	5324.9	[bird of paradis ]	the bird of paradise has hopped onto the perch of the male of her choice. that's a straight invitation to mate.
5330.4	5333.4	[]	act three the approach, head up.
5341.6	5345.1	[]	act four the first physical contact.
5366.8	5371.0	[bird of paradis ]	it looks rough, but presumably bird of paradise likes this sort of treatment.
5371.2	5374.2	[bird of paradis ]	bird of paradise could easily move away if ## didn't.
5382.2	5384.1	[]	and that's it.
5389.3	5395.3	[]	and now there's another to be attended to. there's a queue on this particular perch.
5407.4	5410.2	[bird of paradis ]	this is all bird of paradise does as a father.
5410.4	5414.4	[bird of paradis ]	now bird of paradise'll fly away and raise her young unaided.
5417.3	5423.3	[bird of paradis ]	the bird of paradise on the other perches, in spite of all their efforts, have no success at all.
5432.2	5434.4	[bird of paradis ]	bird of paradise's at it again.
5434.6	5439.3	[bird of paradis ]	but his partner is not reacting properly. bird of paradise's facing away from him.
5441.6	5444.9	[bird of paradis ]	bird of paradise's got it wrong. this is a young male.
5462.7	5466.0	[bird of paradis ]	you don't normally think of bird of paradise as hunters,
5466.2	5472.3	[]	more as gentle vegetarians munching fruit and picking leaves.
5472.9	5479.4	[bird of paradis ]	but if you follow bird of paradise for any length of time in their true home, these forests in west africa,
5479.6	5482.1	[bird of paradis ]	you discover that bird of paradise are hunters.
5482.3	5484.9	[bird of paradis ]	what's more, bird of paradise hunt in teams
5485.1	5492.0	[bird of paradis ]	and have a more complex strategy than any other hunting bird of paradise except...
5492.2	5494.1	[]	(screeching)
5494.3	5497.3	[]	..except, of course, man.
5499.3	5505.9	[bird of paradis ]	and one of the hunters, the experienced bird of paradise, is sitting right there.
5516.2	5519.7	[bird of paradis ]	this is the time bird of paradise hunt, the wet season.
5520.6	5525.1	[monkey , chimp , bird of paradis ]	bird of paradise regular prey are monkeys, but they're very selective.
5526.2	5531.1	[monkey , chimp ]	a diana monkey, a big species, and one they seldom tackle.
5549.4	5551.4	[monkey , chimp ]	a spot-nosed monkey.
5556.0	5562.3	[crab , red colobus , chimp ]	red colobus. better jumpers than chimps and half their weight, they can go on thinner branches,
5562.5	5565.0	[chimp ]	so in theory a chimp can't catch them.
5565.2	5567.6	[chimp ]	but chimp can do so by working as a team,
5567.8	5574.0	[chimp ]	and there are half a dozen experienced chimp in this group of about 60 who regularly do so.
5584.2	5590.1	[chimp ]	this is one of them. from the purposeful way chimp's walking, it's clear the search for prey has started.
5590.2	5593.5	[]	the other members of the team are not far away.
5598.8	5605.2	[monkey , chimp ]	chimp've been steadily following the monkeys for about 20 minutes, looking for an opportunity.
5609.0	5612.6	[chimp ]	the technique chimp'll almost certainly use
5612.8	5617.4	[chimp ]	is that one of chimp will be driving the colobus ahead of him.
5617.6	5623.4	[monkey , chimp ]	others go up on either side, blockers, who won't make any attempt to catch the monkeys.
5623.6	5627.2	[monkey , chimp ]	there are chasers who grab at the monkey if they can.
5627.4	5632.7	[monkey ]	finally, there's one monkey who will go up ahead and ambush it,
5632.9	5636.5	[]	so bringing the whole trap closed.
5639.7	5642.3	[monkey , chimp ]	the monkeys are now getting alarmed.
5645.0	5651.0	[]	a driver's going up to drive them towards an area where they're more easily trapped.
5671.2	5676.1	[]	that's one of the blockers that's now quietly come ahead of the colobus.
5676.3	5679.0	[]	it's halfway up the tree now.
5679.2	5682.2	[monkey ]	monkey's deliberately making himself conspicuous.
5687.6	5691.9	[monkey ]	monkey're all in position. the drivers and blockers have gone up,
5692.1	5697.1	[monkey ]	and the one who's gonna make the ambush and close the ring, monkey's gone up too.
5697.3	5701.2	[monkey ]	the colobus will be very lucky if monkey escape now.
5705.5	5707.9	[]	(screeching)
5713.6	5716.0	[monkey ]	monkey've got one!
5724.3	5727.1	[]	the hunters are tearing it apart.
5728.1	5734.0	[]	the hunters in the trees and the spectators on the ground are screaming with excitement.
5752.4	5758.4	[monkey ]	and now the kill is brought down so that the monkey and others can share it.
5783.3	5789.8	[iguana , monkey ]	after three months buried in monkey eggs, baby green iguanas burst out ready to go.
5791.4	5796.2	[dinosaur ]	we know from fossils that some baby dinosaurs hatched from communal nests,
5796.4	5798.7	[]	but what happened next?
5804.4	5808.3	[iguana ]	first, iguana babies dig their way up to the surface.
5808.5	5812.1	[iguana ]	instantly alert, iguana emerge into a dangerous world.
5820.8	5825.1	[]	hundreds break out from different clutches over several days.
5832.0	5835.9	[]	instead of striking out alone, the babies form peer groups,
5836.0	5839.8	[]	unexpected behaviour for primitive reptiles.
5843.4	5849.5	[iguana ]	iguana taste each other, forging social bonds that may help them survive a risky start.
5856.2	5861.9	[iguana ]	one iguana takes the lead. the others follow. they need to get to cover urgently.
5862.1	5865.7	[iguana ]	here, iguana green colour is no camouflage.
5868.2	5872.7	[lizard , t rex ]	a basilisk lizard, a flesh-eater like prehistoric t-rex,
5872.9	5875.9	[]	here to intercept the passing herd.
5893.8	5897.4	[]	dramas like this, between reptile predator and prey,
5897.6	5900.4	[]	have been played out for millions of years.
5908.5	5914.7	[lizard , t rex ]	like t-rex, the basilisk runs down his quarry on strongly-muscled back legs.
5921.9	5924.7	[]	instinctively, the babies head for water.
5935.4	5939.6	[t rex ]	t-rex scaly feet trap air bubbles that act like stepping stones,
5939.8	5942.4	[t rex ]	so t-rex can literally walk on water.
5956.4	5960.6	[]	this is just the first of many dangers that threaten the babies.
5960.8	5963.4	[]	the next is starvation.
5969.0	5972.5	[]	one of the most extraordinary of these insect enticers
5972.7	5976.7	[]	lives here in the tropical rainforest of sumatra.
5976.9	5983.9	[]	it only flowers once in 1,000 days, and when the flower develops, it only lasts for three days,
5984.1	5988.8	[]	so very few people have seen it, but here it is.
5990.3	5994.7	[]	technically, it's a whole group of flowers clustered around this,
5994.9	5998.8	[]	but you could be justified for regarding it as one flower.
5999.0	6003.9	[]	and if you do that, this is the biggest flower in the world.
6004.1	6010.8	[arum ]	it's related to the dead horse arum, but it's nine feet tall and three feet across.
6011.0	6015.0	[arum ]	it's amorphophallus titanum, the titan arum.
6016.2	6020.9	[]	the function of this great spike in the middle is to produce a smell...
6022.8	6027.5	[]	and if you smell it, it smells very strongly of bad fish.
6027.6	6034.2	[]	this apparently attracts insects which come along here and go down into this great funnel
6034.4	6037.8	[]	to the small flowers that grow at the base.
6039.6	6045.7	[arum ]	until this film was taken, no one was sure what insect pollinated the titan arum.
6045.9	6051.0	[bee ]	as we watched, we saw that, without doubt, the job was done by tiny sweat bees.
6052.7	6056.4	[arum ]	like other arums, the male flowers form a band at the top.
6061.7	6066.3	[arum ]	below arum, the female flowers, with long, yellow-tipped stigmas.
6072.1	6076.3	[bee ]	the bees found some reward on the stigmas, for they crawled over them,
6076.5	6079.8	[bee ]	distributing the pollen bee'd brought with them.
6080.0	6086.5	[arum ]	but why does the titan arum produce the biggest bloom in the world to attract such tiny pollinators?
6086.7	6090.9	[bee ]	to be effective, these bees must bring pollen from another bloom,
6091.1	6096.9	[]	but since the plant is rare and only flowers once in three years, the nearest may be miles away.
6097.1	6102.6	[]	it's not easy to spread perfume over such distances in the air of the rainforest.
6102.8	6110.0	[]	perhaps the best way to do so is to disperse it from a spire, like smoke from a factory chimney.
6130.6	6135.3	[]	there is more meaning and mutual understanding
6135.4	6142.3	[gorilla ]	in exchanging a glance with a gorilla than any other animal i know.
6144.1	6146.1	[]	we're so similar.
6147.3	6151.7	[gorilla ]	gorilla sight, their hearing, their sense of smell,
6151.8	6158.1	[gorilla ]	gorilla're so similar to ours that we see the world in the same way as they do.
6159.2	6166.9	[gorilla ]	gorilla live in the same sort of social groups, have permanent family relationships.
6167.0	6171.0	[gorilla ]	gorilla walk around on the ground as we do, though they're...
6172.6	6175.0	[]	immensely more powerful than we are.
6175.2	6180.6	[]	and so if ever there was a possibility of escaping the human condition
6180.8	6183.6	[]	and living imaginatively...
6186.0	6188.1	[]	(grunts)
6188.3	6193.1	[gorilla ]	..in another creature's world, it must be with the gorilla.
6195.9	6202.6	[gorilla ]	and yet, as i sit here surrounded by this trusting gorilla family...
6204.9	6211.0	[gorilla ]	gorilla're gentle, placid creatures.
6211.2	6215.1	[gorilla ]	the boss of the group is that silverback male.
6215.2	6219.6	[gorilla ]	the rest are adult gorilla with their young sons and daughters,
6219.8	6222.8	[gorilla ]	and this is how gorilla spend most of their time,
6223.0	6226.1	[]	lounging on the ground, grooming one another.
6242.8	6246.2	[gorilla ]	the gorilla is an enormously powerful creature,
6246.4	6253.4	[gorilla ]	but gorilla only uses his strength when ## is actually protecting his own family
6253.6	6257.3	[gorilla ]	from a marauding gorilla from another group.
6258.9	6265.6	[]	and it's very, very rare that there is any violence within the group.
6267.7	6273.3	[gorilla ]	so it seems really very unfair that man should have chosen the gorilla
6273.4	6278.0	[]	to symbolise all that is aggressive and violent,
6278.2	6282.9	[gorilla ]	when that's the one thing that the gorilla is not and that we are.
6293.6	6298.1	[]	that grasping, manipulative hand has now become something more
6298.3	6302.1	[]	an instrument with which to explore and investigate.
6302.9	6307.9	[]	the fingers can revolve a small object and investigate it from every angle.
6308.0	6311.0	[gorilla ]	gorilla feel not only its shape but its texture,
6311.2	6315.9	[]	for the fingers, no longer required to be put flat on the ground,
6316.0	6322.3	[]	have sensitive pads at the end, covered with tiny ridges of skin to enhance the sense of touch.
6322.5	6327.5	[gorilla ]	every gorilla, in fact, has its own unique fingerprints, just as we have.
6342.3	6348.3	[gorilla ]	the gorilla family spends its day gently grazing, and there's plenty of time for play.
6367.9	6372.7	[gorilla ]	half-grown blackback males regularly have wrestling matches.
6435.1	6438.7	[gorilla ]	sometimes gorilla even allow others to join in.
6474.1	6479.7	[gorilla ]	though gorilla may play games, you don't forget that these are the rulers of the forest,
6479.9	6483.3	[gorilla ]	and the great silverback is king of the whole group.
6483.5	6486.8	[gorilla ]	gorilla's so enormously strong that ## need fear nothing,
6487.0	6490.7	[]	except a man armed with a spear or a gun.
